# BigWarps - Bukkit plugin for public and private warps

BigWarps is the expanded version of SmallWarps.  It includes the same /tpa and /back functionality, but the /home and /warp components have been completely pulled out and replaced with a much more powerful system.  The BigWarps warp system removes the idea of moderator warps, and instead brings server-wide public and private warps to both players and staff.

Features:
* TPA system (/tpa, /tpaccept, /tpdeny, automatic timeouts)
* Return points (/back, death points, wraps vanilla TP command)
* Private warps (easily create, edit, and warp to own points, permissions allow staff to bypass restrictions)
* Public warps (any private warp can be made public, list command to see who has available points, permission controlled)
